# Snake
Just a snake game written in Javascript

First time creating or posting a repository so, I'm trying to figure all this out..

If you stumble across this pretty please leave all kinds of comments and anything that can/will help.. very new and lost here.. on github... 
Coding I'm fine for the most part haha... 
Please feel free to comment on that too though!!!

But!! Here is a snake game.. super simple... works like you think it should.
Use j, i, k, l to move the snake instead of arrow or a, w, s, d.

My "a" key seems to be acting funny so... I didn't want to use it..
