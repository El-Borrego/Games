# Snake
Just a snake game written in Javascript

First time creating or posting a repository so, I'm trying to figure all this out..
But!! Here is a snake game.. super simple... works like you think it should.
Use j,i,k,l to move the snake instead of arrow or a,w,s,d.

My "a" key seems to be acting funny so... I didn't want to use it..
